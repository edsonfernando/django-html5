HTML5 support for django.

Features:
- Form fields and widgets for HTML5 input types.
- Javascript fallback for autofocus attribute of inputs if you want it. As seen here: http://diveintohtml5.org/forms.html

Features added by Marinho Brandao on his fork:
- Middleware to check if current browser supports HTML5 and set it to attribute
  'request.supports_html5'
- Monkey patch to replace function 'find_template' to find for '.html5' instead of '.html'
  as priority
